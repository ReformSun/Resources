## 在提交本地变化的文档时，出现错误

```
To https://github.com/ReformSun/Resources.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/ReformSun/Resources.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
```

## 先通过远程仓库更新本地仓库

```
git pull origin
remote: Enumerating objects: 7, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (7/7), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.

Unpacking objects: 100% (4/4), done.
From https://github.com/ReformSun/Resources

Auto-merging git/测试文件.md
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in git/测试文件.md
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

## 远程其他人或者在服务器上对文件进行了更改

- 查看冲突状态

```
git status
On branch master
Your branch and 'origin/master' have diverged,
and have 1 and 1 different commits each, respectively.
  (use "git pull" to merge the remote branch into yours)

You have unmerged paths.
  (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
  (use "git merge --abort" to abort the merge)

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)

	both modified:   "git/\346\265\213\350\257\225\346\226\207\344\273\266.md"

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   "git/\345\206\262\347\252\201\350\247\243\345\206\263.md"

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

- 在本地修改冲突文件
